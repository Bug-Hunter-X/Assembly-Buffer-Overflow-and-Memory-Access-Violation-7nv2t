# Assembly Language Bug: Buffer Overflow and Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow and memory access violation vulnerability in a short assembly language code snippet.  The code is designed to illustrate these common errors, and a solution to mitigate the risk is provided.

**Vulnerability:**
The primary concern lies in the lack of bounds checking. The code fails to verify the validity of the `ecx` register before accessing memory using it as an index.  If `ecx` is too large, it could attempt to access memory locations outside the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, writing to memory at the address in `eax` without validation could result in a memory access violation if the address is invalid (e.g., points outside the program's address space).

**Solution:**
The solution provides corrected code that includes bounds checking to prevent the buffer overflow and appropriate error handling.
